# TextToMath
This program allows for user to enter a set of mathematical expressions as a string and get the solution. This program is initially created to support the KiCAD_Coil repository but it grew to become a handy and fast offline calculator that became really useful!

This program can support basic mathematical expressions such as addition, substraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponents.
This program does also support mathematical constants and expressions such as pi, Euler's number, square root, rounding, flooring, and ceiling.

In the example folder there is an example code that you can run to play with it. It will ask you to enter a mathematical equation or an expression and it will solve it for you. Try something hard! If it does not work please contact me so I can fix the bug.

More updates will be coming as needed to fix bugs or add new mathematical functionalities such as complex numbers, calculus, etc...
